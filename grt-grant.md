## Marketing Case Studies

### Problem:

The Graph is confronted with a central problem: highly prolific DeFi and Web3 projects such as Uniswap, Coingecko, Synthetix, Aragon, Balancer, Aave, and DAOstack are using The Graph protocol in production. **Yet, most of the users of these services and many developers of similar dApps are not aware of The Graph making all these applications work** without the need for centralized infrastructure. **As a consequence, a large number of teams and projects like CoinMarketCap are still developing and operating proprietary indexing servers.**

To help The Graph increase brand awareness within the target audience of dApp developers, I would like to propose ghost authoring several case studies that show in detail, how The Graph allows developers to offer truly serverless decentralized applications that are fast to load and dependable. All rights to the case studies will be handed over to The Graph Foundation. The intention behind the specific case studies is to tell a compelling story to potential clients of The Graph and to showcase The Graph’s credibility in solving particularly challenging client problems. Furthermore, the content can be used to highlight the network’s ability to deliver measurable results based on KPIs and is able to reduce the indexing costs substantially. Doing so will allow The Graph to position itself as an authority within the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem.

**Definition of success:** a case study with one client of The Graph is finalized. KPIs: 

I\) number of new projects that are being onboarded with The Graph.   
II\) number of top layer 1 blockchains that are integrating The Graph’s decentralized indexing layer on their blockchain.   
III\) Number of views/likes of the case study.

The main goal of creating these case studies is to increase brand awareness within the target group of dApp developers. It is also intended that the case studies lend further credibility to The Graph, which will aid in integrating its decentralized indexing layer on top layer 1 blockchains.

**\(Never written a case study before\)** BUT:

* I've got experience in writing academic research papers as I have written a master thesis and have got multiple years of work experience in writing engaging marketing content. 
* Worked as a marketing manager and now as a head of marketing so I also have the necessary background
* This is why I have created a preview version of an example case study using Uniswap so the **MVP already exists**. To show that I can pull it off and have the necessary credibility to do so. This project it's **all about getting the necessary data** from the team but also from Uniswap that I can dig into.

The roadmap is intended as follows: 

* conduct interviews with Uniswap founder/developers
* conduct interviews with  The Graph team about Uniswap
* gain access to statistic material from Uniswap \(cost reductions, etc.\)
* evaluate statistic material and visualize it in a compelling way
* use the insights gained from the interviews and the statistics to write the copy for a compelling case study
* the last milestone is the publication of the case study.

## Community Ambassador Program

### 

### Problem:

Many reputable blockchain projects such as Mina Protocol \[by 0\(1\)Labs\] have established Community Ambassador Programs in order to **grow, excite and organize their global community**. To help The Graph Network in growing and increasing its brand awareness all around the globe and to strengthen its local communities, I would like to propose the establishment of a Community Ambassador Program.

Local Community Ambassadors could help The Graph to **grow strong communities around the globe by organizing local virtual meetups, conducting workshops, establishing a presence for The Graph on geographically-relevant platforms** \(i.e. Xing in Germany, WeChat in China\), create local Telegram groups, produce/translate educational content, recruit new community members and act as spokespeople for the project.

**Definition of success:** the Community Ambassador Program has been launched successfully.

The expected impact of the project is to help The Graph team to **better organize its worldwide community and to foster its healthy growth**. In doing so, it is intended to **grow brand awareness** for the project so that interested developers start building dApps that use The Graph network.

### Roadmap:

I would like to apply to become the Community Ambassador Coordinator. My very first task will be **to develop a strategy of implementing the Community Ambassador Program**. I would like to help in **selecting candidates** for important regions \(Russia, China, Korea, Italian, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Turkey, France, Japan, Africa and the Arabian Peninsula\). In a second step, I would like to **draft marketing activities, workshops, virtual meet ups that the local Community Ambassador can implement in their region and control activities based on KPIs**.

I would also like to apply to become the local Community Ambassador for Germany. I am a German citizen and would love to help build a local community for the “DACH” region \(Germany, Austria and Switzerland\).

Milestone I: finish a **draft for the Community Ambassador Program**. Milestone II: open registration for the program. Milestone III: select local Community Ambassadors. Milestone IV: develop marketing activities for the Community Ambassadors.

I have never been a community ambassador so far. However, I have participated in communities and helped community ambassadors with their different tasks. **Even though I never was a community ambassador I have experience in all the tasks required such as hosting virtual meet ups, establishing online presences, creating content etc.** I've also got experience in building communities from my role as head of marketing

I would be more than happy to get going and develop a strategy for the community Amb. program right now.

## `Required Funding:`

Comparable to the prices paid in Mina Protocol \[by 0\(1\)Labs\] to community ambassadors I would like to propose the following but am of course open to discussion:

**$2000/month in GRT for the Community Ambassador Germany, Austria, Switzerland role  
$3000/month in GRT for the Community Ambassador Coordinator role**

{% tab title="Meetups" %}
## Community Meetups

  
The Graph ecosystem is growing at an exponential rate. We can see by the number of questions and requests by new members, that there is a big demand to learn more about The Graph network. I would like to organize a free quarterly community meet up as an online event. Additionally, I would also like to host Q&As and other events that cover recent developments in the ecosystem. These live streams, workshops and presentations are focused on The Graph ecosystem – by the community, for the community. Our topics cover everything there is to know for The Graph enthusiasts such as new developments, news, Web3, DeFi and the latest tips and tricks for indexers and curators. The first meet up will be hosted on March 19th 2021. Initially, I have created the meet up with Eventbrite because it is free to use. However, should I receive a grant for these meet ups, I am planning to buy a Meetup.com membership so that we can launch a more professional looking group. The meet ups will always be free, no fees will be charged. Definition of success: the quarterly meet up is successfully conducted.

The goal of these quarterly meet ups and the various other online events is to educate the community and to give community members the opportunity to network with like-minded individuals. The events will allow members to ask their questions and to learn more about The Graph. Additionally, it is intended to share valuable tips and tricks for indexers, curators and everyone else interested in the ecosystem.

## Medium articles / FAQs

  
Comparing indexers with each other can be quite difficult, especially for new and inexperienced delegators. To avoid costly mistakes, I have written an in-depth guide on how to identify profitable indexers. I would like to continue with this tutorial series to help educate the community around the topics of delegating and curating. The article series will describe everything delegators need to know to meet intelligent and profitable delegation decisions. Definition of success: the article is published on medium.

Based on the community feedback I can see on Reddit, Telegram and the Discord server, curators and community members alike struggle with identifying profitable indexers that they can delegate to. Based on my research and experiences in creating the delegation calculator, I would like to create an extensive video that details everything new and existing members need to know about dedicating. From calculating delegation rewards, comparing indexers, and actually delegating the chosen amount of GRT, this video will describe everything delegators need to know to meet an intelligent decision. Definition of success: the video is finished and uploaded to YouTube.

## Community Podcast

  
The graph community is growing rapidly. But so far, there is little community coverage of the project from community members – those that follow the project for month and those that absolutely love it. What the ecosystem lacks is interesting show formats that cover the latest developments of the protocol. At the moment, it is easy to miss important news and announcements. To help community members stay up to date and to discuss topics in a more detailed manner, I would like to launch a community podcast – for the community, by the community. Definition of success: An episode of the podcast is uploaded to Soundcloud/YouTube or even iTunes and distributed among the community channels. KPIs: number of listeners, number of shares in social media, number of likes.

At a later stage, I would like to invite interesting community members to the podcast so as to give these individuals a voice. I want to conduct interviews with indexers about insights into indexing and they would like to invite successful curators and delegators to show to discuss the strategies they apply. Overall, this podcast is intended to help educate the community in a wide variety of subjects and to help the community stay up-to-date with recent developments. This podcast can also be used to explain complex developments in a more detailed nature.

Definition of success: the video is finished and uploaded to YouTube.

At the moment, many delegators lack clarity on how to choose the right indexer. This results in an unnecessary workload for team members and increases frustration in the community base. By showing delegators how to evaluate indexers, they are able to meet intelligent delegation decisions. The intended video series is a guide that takes delegators through the entire process of using available tools to select the best indexers.

#### **address how all stakeholders benefit!**

The Graph ecosystem is confronted with the key challenge of having to onboard a wide variety of new community members with different knowledge levels and varying participation roles. As we have seen in the last months, the community growth around The Graph Protocol is accelerating at an advanced pace. It is therefore of existential importance to provide new and existing network participants a vast knowledge base about The Graph ecosystem. 

We therefore propose the establishment of **The Graph Academy** – a new and interactive platform for educational content, community documentation and an open-source library of resources for developers and network participants. The vision behind The Graph Academy is to create a vast knowledge base that allows community members to learn the intricacies of The Graph Protocol.

As an extension of the official documentation by The Graph Network, The Graph Academy will help to onboard new dApp Developers, Indexers, Curators and Delegators starting from scratch. The platform is intended to provide resources for all those who want to build decentralized applications that query data from The GraphQL API and those that want to participate in the network. The establishment of The Graph Academy will help to further reduce the barrier to building the infrastructure for Web3 applications. The resources provided by The Graph Network will be especially critical as dApps continue to disrupt established industries, attracting more and more Web2.0 developers to the Web3.0 ecosystem. 

As part of the grant, we would like to lead several initiatives that help to bring key on-boarding resources to the wider Graph community, including: 

* An educational website that contains educational series and an open-source resource hub providing information and training specific to The Graph ecosystem. This could include guides and tutorials for Indexers, Curators and Delegators as well as developer tutorials, step-by-step how-to guides and interactive coding exercises
* Beginner developer courses detailing the fundamentals of core The Graph Protocol features
